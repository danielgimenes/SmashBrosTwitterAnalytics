SmashBrosTwitterAnalytics
=========================

October 3rd was the release date of Super Smash Bros for 3DS - Nintendo’s newest game for its portable video-game console. Knowing this and wanting to practice some programming I decided to create a little pet project. “#SmashBros Twitter Analytics” is composed of two softwares: a service to capture and process Twitter data related to the game, and a website to show some interesting information about the tweets. Both were developed in Java platforms and had their code published on GitHub. 

The website is (for now) hosted on Amazon Web Services, and can be visited through the link: ~~http://54.69.148.65/SmashBrosTwitterAnalytics/~~
